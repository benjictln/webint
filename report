Report for this assignement:

Our webpage is describing a social network, named "Share". This social network would enable the user to write and see posts in the newsfeed,
to comment and archive them, to build groups for an easy sharing, etc...
The share button near the comment bar, would allow a quick sharing or archiving.
Some ads adapted to the user's tastes appear in the right side section.
As expected, the links to other pages are only figurative at the moment and not yet functional.

Some operational examples of possible posts are given: forms, videos, geolocalisation,...
To make sure the video is viewable on Firefox, Safari, Iphone, we put it in mp4 and in ogv.

Our website is responsive and adaptative to mobile screens.
We used the meta tag viewport and the @media in CSS to have only one column instead of three on mobile and others small screen devices.

We spent approximately 25 hours in total on the realization of this website.
